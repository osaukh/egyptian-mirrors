# egyptian-mirrors

This repository contains the code that was used to evluate Egyptian Mirrors defense, a variant of Moving Target defense used in the paper 'Escaping Adversarial Attacks using Egyptian Mirrors'.

The iPython notebooks can be executed in Google Colab.

Note that the implementation of Egyptian Mirrors defense use neuron alignment and REPAIR procedure as implemented by Jordan Keller: [https://github.com/KellerJordan/REPAIR.git](https://github.com/KellerJordan/REPAIR.git)

We use `torchattacks` library for the implementation of adversarial attacks: [https://github.com/Harry24k/adversarial-attacks-pytorch.git](https://github.com/Harry24k/adversarial-attacks-pytorch.git)
